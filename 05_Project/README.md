# Stock Trend Estimation Using Sentiment Analysis 

In response to the enduring challenge of navigating stock market volatility, this project introduces an approach for daily stock trend estimation for companies listed on NASDAQ and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India. Traditional reliance on historical data for trend prediction proves inadequate due to unpredictable external factors. The project addresses this gap by formulating a predictive model that encapsulates the interplay of information and emotion in contemporary finance.

Recognizing the imperative role of market sentiment in investor decision-making, the project extends its focus to the burgeoning interest in stock market investments among Indian stakeholders. Given the prevalence of web-based data in Indian languages, with Hindi as a dominant language, the project undertakes the critical task of constructing a sentiment analysis model tailored to the nuances of Hindi. This model categorizes headlines into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, offering vital insights into the sentiments influencing market trends.

At its core, the project relies on a rich dataset comprising labeled tweets, headlines, and reviews for training a sentiment analysis model. Leveraging advanced models such as ULMFiT and LSTM, the project employs transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained Hindi language model. Once trained, the model analyzes news headlines, manually extracted or scraped from finviz, to gauge public sentiment toward a company. Positive sentiment may signal investment opportunities, negative sentiment could prompt divestment, and neutral sentiment suggests maintaining holdings. By delivering actionable insights, this project seeks to empower Indian investors and traders, elevating their financial decision-making processes in the dynamic landscape of the stock market.
