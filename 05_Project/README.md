# Stock Trend Estimation Using Sentiment Analysis 

This project aims to revolutionize stock market analysis by developing a robust predictive model for estimating daily stock trends on NASDAQ and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in India. Recognizing the volatility of financial markets and the inadequacy of relying solely on historical data, the project focuses on sentiment analysis, particularly in Hindi, to capture the nuances of investor emotions. Leveraging pre-trained models like ULMFiT, the project fine-tunes a Hindi language model using a comprehensive dataset of labeled tweets, headlines, and reviews.

The heart of the initiative lies in providing actionable insights for investors by analyzing news headlines related to listed companies. Utilizing the sentiment classifier, the project discerns public sentiment—positive, negative, or neutral—enabling investors to make informed decisions. A positive sentiment may encourage additional stock purchases, while a negative sentiment could prompt stock sales. Neutral sentiment advises investors to hold. By integrating linguistic nuances and real-time sentiment analysis, the project strives to enhance the decision-making processes of Indian investors and traders, fostering a more informed and dynamic approach to navigating the complex landscape of the stock market.
